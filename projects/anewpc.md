It was the summer of 2024, and I was getting ready to transfer to UH Manoa. I had packed everything for the move, except for my PC. My PC, which I built in 2019, was getting packed and ready to get shipped from the mainland to the islands. However, at this point, I had decided that it was also time to upgrade a couple of components of my PC to future-proof it for the next 6 years of my life with it. So I began looking online at PCPartPicker.

With the goal of wanting to future-proof my build, I decided to get a new processor and graphics card. Fortunately, I had my old build specs on there already, so I went in just swapping the parts out on their site. I found some higher-end, but not too expensive parts (AMD processor and an NVIDIA 40 Series), and then I noticed the error on the website, saying that there was a compatibility issue. The processor wouldn't fit into my current motherboard. I was stumped for a while, trying to figure out why, until I realized the problem: the AMD processor I wanted was on a newer chip socket, the AM5, while my old motherboard was utilizing the AM4. At the time I had built the PC, AM4 was the new and improved chip socket, so now I was using older technology. Thus, I was faced with a decision- either to use my old motherboard and get an older processor with less future-proofing ability, or buy a new motherboard. I opted for the latter and swapped the motherboard. Then I was hit with another error- insufficient power. By wanting to upgrade my graphics card, I was running into power issues in my build, meaning I would have to either buy a new power supply or keep my old graphics card. These problems continued, as I realized I needed new storage because my solid-state drives were reaching the upper thresholds of average lifespan, so I would need to replace those, and a RAM stick upgrade to work with the new processor, and a new case because I needed to accommodate the size difference in parts. 

By this time, I realized that in my pursuit to do a "simple upgrade", I had to have swapped out essentially every part of my build. So, I ended up buying all the parts and built a brand new PC in Hawaii, leaving my old PC at home for when I go to visit.

From this experience, I actually learned a lot about how even a simple solution can cascade into a much larger problem. The ripple effect of wanting to upgrade one part that turned into needing to fully rebuild nearly everything not only highlighted how fast technology was evolving, but also how much like in coding, trying to solve one problem brings upon many more. On the bright side, at least I have a PC that will last me for a (decently) long time to come.
