# Project: Grocery Run and Carpooling App
## Overview
*The problem* In general, the nutritional intake of college students is relatively poor. In both on and off campus living, students feel inclined to opt for ready-made or take-out to be more time efficient, and generally don't have the time or drive to get fresh groceries. In addition, some students may not have access to a personal vehicle, and would rather not walk or take a gamble on bus times in Hawaiian climate to do grocery shopping that include perishable items. In some cases, students may use food or grocery-delivery services such as Instacart, DoorDash, Hello Fresh, etc, but the quality of these products is entirely dependant on the whims of the in-store shopper and not the student themself.

*The Solution* The solution proposed is a commmunity carpool app, somewhat similar to rideshare apps to carpool together for grocery trips. The idea is to have an app specifically designed to put users (one with a personal vehicle, and however many they are willing to carpool with) who are going to the same grocery store together. It will also double as a quick map pinpointing all nearby grocery stores, including small business grocers and daily farmers markets.

## Mockup Ideas
- Landing page
- User home page
- Nearby store search page
- Upcoming Farmers Markets
- Store carpool search/scheduler page

## Use Case Ideas
- a new user reaches on landing page, creates an account, gets to the home page and sets up their profile
- a current user uses the nearby store search page and upcoming farmers market page to determine see what stores or events are nearby
- a user logs in and uses the store carpool search/scheduler page to select where they want to shop at and when, setting themselves as a "rider" with a number on how many groceries they expect to have
- a user logs in and uses the store carpool search/scheduler to select the grocery shopping they want to do and sets themselves as a "driver" in addition to inputting how many carpool seats they have open 
## Beyond the Basics
After the core of this works, additional functionality can be provided
- AI functionality to recommend nearby groceries, promotions, or events
- Review system for both drivers and riders
